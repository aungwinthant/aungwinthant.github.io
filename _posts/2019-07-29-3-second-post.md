**Second Nightmare**

It was Thursday. The weather was cloudy as usual Yangon. I went to phandeeyar for an event. I went not because I liked the event but because I like the view from phandeeyar. It was overwhelming. During the event, I saw Moe Lone Pyae Shan, a dude who run CS50, and I said hello to him and he said “I am about to move things to my new office would you like to come visit to my office?”. I knew suddenly he was having trouble with the stuffs and he needed help. By that time, I was talking with a dude from hostel, a CS50 colleague. That dude said no. But I said yes. If I wanted to survive in Yangon, I needed some friends in tech environment and what the heck he had hosted CS50 and because of him I completed CS50. After carrying some chairs and stuffs to 5th floor (it’s not easy :D), Moe Lone offered me a job. So you know me, I said yes again. To be honest, I didn’t know why I said yes. When I got back to hostel, I was confused with doubts and everything. “Is it the right move? or what should I do next?” I really didn’t know what to do next. But I decided that “I will do the best I can and I will try harder and I will be successful in coming years.”.

It was very hard for me to struggle between the work and school time. I realized I needed to focus on the web development and less school time. So I prioritized the work over school (I don’t regret about it). Though I enjoyed working, solving problems and studying much, I was very lost when I went to school. I was studying business and information technology related subjects at school and those subjects bored me to death. Most importantly, I couldn’t use my laptop at lecture times. Teachers used books, BOOKS! what the fuck. And they yelled at the students if they used laptop (believe me I was yelled). Irony isn’t it? School teaching computer related subjects was using books and yelled the students for using laptops at lecture times LOL. :D. So school become my nightmare gradually but I have to get that degree for my parents, my big brother and my girlfriend. After all they had sacrificed so much for me. And it goes on and on and on………………………………
