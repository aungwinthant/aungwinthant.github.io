<p><strong>Second Nightmare</strong></p>

<p>It was Thursday. The weather was cloudy as usual Yangon. I went to phandeeyar for an event. I went not because I liked the event but because I like the view from phandeeyar. It was overwhelming. During the event, I saw Moe Lone Pyae Shan, a dude who run CS50, and I said hello to him and he said “I am about to move things to my new office would you like to come visit to my office?”. I knew suddenly he was having trouble with the stuffs and he needed help. By that time, I was talking with a dude from hostel, a CS50 colleague. That dude said no. But I said yes. If I wanted to survive in Yangon, I needed some friends in tech environment and what the heck he had hosted CS50 and because of him I completed CS50. After carrying some chairs and stuffs to 5th floor (it’s not easy :D), Moe Lone offered me a job. So you know me, I said yes again. To be honest, I didn’t know why I said yes. When I got back to hostel, I was confused with doubts and everything. “Is it the right move? or what should I do next?” I really didn’t know what to do next. But I decided that “I will do the best I can and I will try harder and I will be successful in coming years.”.</p>

<p>It was very hard for me to struggle between the work and school time. I realized I needed to focus on the web development and less school time. So I prioritized the work over school (I don’t regret about it). Though I enjoyed working, solving problems and studying much, I was very lost when I went to school. I was studying business and information technology related subjects at school and those subjects bored me to death. Most importantly, I couldn’t use my laptop at lecture times. Teachers used books, BOOKS! what the fuck. And they yelled at the students if they used laptop (believe me I was yelled). Irony isn’t it? School teaching computer related subjects was using books and yelled the students for using laptops at lecture times LOL. :D. So school become my nightmare gradually but I have to get that degree for my parents, my big brother and my girlfriend. After all they had sacrificed so much for me. And it goes on and on and on………………………………</p>

<p><strong>First Nightmare</strong></p>

<p>When I first came to Yangon in 2016 December, I came with a big dream. I wanted to provide a solution to the copy right issues which is currently affecting the music industry badly. At first I thought about developing an android application in which songs could be streamed online and played offline only with my application. And then I would pay the stakeholders (artists, company etc) depending on the stream price of the song.(Yes exactly like Spotify). Back in Mandalay I studied android application development via Udacity and I completed four courses (Completed sunshine app if you know what I mean). Things were going ok and I found out that there was a study group in Yangon for CS50 which I enrolled in 2015 and didn’t complete. So I decided to enroll again and joined the study group. Long story short- I ended up studying C and Python. I evaluated myself for what I want to create. If I want to create a online music streaming application, I will definitely need to know web technologies. It took only five minutes to decide that I will switch to web development. It was because I lacked total faith in android application development (This is me and my only opinion. Android Development is very nice and fun). I wanted more fun. I just want flexibility and more importantly I don’t want to write the two different code for two mobile operating system for the same application. So yes damn right I switched. (This was before Kotlin was announced). The night was long that night. I am still depending on my parents and I am doing what I want to do rather than what I should do. You might say that I am a burden to the family. Well……………….welcome to one of my nightmares……!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>To be continued…………………………………….</p>
